# Employee Retention
The goal of this project is to understand the factors that cause employees to leave a company, specifically IBM. The dataset can be [downloaded](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset) from Kaggle.

Companies spend resources (time, money, training) to upskill and hire their workforce. Understanding the features that correlate with employees leaving the company can help direct the company and HR to have discussions with at risk employees. Having these discussions, if done effectively, could help prevent the high cost of training new employees.
